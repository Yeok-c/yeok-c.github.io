- I grew up in Penang, Malaysia - an island known for community, culture, and engineering. 
- I was awarded The Hong Kong Jockey Club Full Entry Scholarship and received my Bachelor in Electronic and Information Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2022.
- During my undergraduate studies, on top of taking related subjects, I pursued Artificial Intelligence / Deep Learning:
  - as a research assistant in Prof. Joanne Yip's team, for sports science applications
  - as a FYP student under Prof. Mak Man Wai, on detecting modified car engine sounds
  - as a participant in Prof. Edward Chung's Reinforcement Learning Reading Club
- I worked at The Hong Kong Centre for Logistic Robotics as a software engineer, particularly computer vision algorithms and deployment and assisted in research work.
