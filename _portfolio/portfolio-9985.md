During my internship last summer, I had the privilege of collaborating closely with the owner of a SME, engaging in a diverse range of projects that challenged and expanded my skills.

One of the key projects I undertook was designing and prototyping IoT clocks for Affinex. These dot-matrix clocks were equipped with sensors and speakers and are capable of displaying simple text messages. This project honed in my proficiency in creating smart, interconnected devices while exploring the realms of the Internet of Things. I used the following tools:
- Hardware: Laser-cut and 3D printed parts designed in Fusion 360
- Electronics: EasyEDA and JLCPCB for design and fabrication respectively
- Microcontroller: ESP32 as an IoT-capable microcontroller, programmed in Arduino IDE
- IoT hosting: Firebase

I also motorized a laser engraver's plotting platform, by integrating NEMA17 stepper motors, drivers, an Arduino and buttons to automate the platform, enhancing its efficiency and user experience. Beyond that, I took charge of drafting documentation and guidelines on how to use their 3D printers and 400W laser cutter.  

As part of my contributions to Affinex's corporate social responsibility, I spearheaded the "Young Engineer's 100 Days Makerthon". The hackerthon aimed to engage and inspire high school students in the field of electronics and engineering. We designed an advanced STEM curriculum based on Affinex's electronic product development flow, providing students with a structured learning experience that mirrored the real-world industry's best practices. Unlike a conventional weekend hackathon, the makerthon spans 3-months, with weekly workshops during the student's extracurricular-activity times, which taught students technical skills such as PCB design, CAD design and MCU programming. 

Throughout the journey we had forged valuable connections between industry engineers, school administrators alumni and students within the community. We held a small founding ceremony of what we call the "Creative Electronics Alumni-Advisor Group", commemorating the occasion and celebrating the beginning of a collaborative network that would foster continuous growth and learning within the field of electronics and engineering in the local community.
