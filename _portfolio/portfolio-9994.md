Founded by Michael Campbell, a polyglot and linguist (among other titles), Glossika strives to use data-driven methods to stay competitive in the very saturated market of language-learning apps.

I interned here at the end of my first year (2019) - I ended up pre-processing text data, [writing and editing blogs](https://ai.glossika.com/blog/author/cheah), and doing other intern-level work.
