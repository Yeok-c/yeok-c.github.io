As part of our EIE course we have to complete IC382 - Multidisciplinary Manufacturing Project. We worked with students from different disciplines, including mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, electronic-and-information engineering and computer science students to create a rescue robot. 

I developed the stabilizer including mechanical and electronic design, controls and software. I designed a 2 axis gimbal design with accelerometer feedback. Initially, we used a lighter design with less inertia. We switched to a larger platform later in the project.

I later redesigned it with larger servo motors to accomodate for larger loads
